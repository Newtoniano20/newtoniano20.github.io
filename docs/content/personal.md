# Personal Life

Hi, this is where I show more of my personal life, what I like to do in my free time and some updates on my life. If you need more personal context about me, I'm an [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/infp-a/m/ejmc0u4cj) (ofc, take this with a grain of salt, as it is pseudoscience). 

As hobbies, right now I play the **Violin** (have been since 2022), I have recently started to learn **Chinese**, as a very long term project (I don't think I will be decent for a while).
