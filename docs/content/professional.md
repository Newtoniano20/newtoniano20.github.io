# Professional Life

As of 2026, I have not done much professionally, as I am still doing my Bachelor's, but here is a list of what I have done so far.

In October 2025, I started my first internship, at SEAT S.A., a car company that is part of the Volkswagen Group and produces hundreds of thousands of cars every year. This was my first time working at a company of this size, as most of my life I have worked with smaller groups with little to no bureaucracy. 

Even though this was a challenge at first, I got to learn a lot about the inner workings and the car production. My work mostly involves the creation of prototypes for digitalizing processes and systems that either take too long or are too inefficient.

During the summer, I was a summer camp counselor at a language school in Barcelona.
