            Currently I am the Mission Manager (CEO) of GRASS, a team building a martian rover to compete in the European Rover Challenge, a competition hosted by the European Space Foundation where teams from around the world and different universities compete in challenges that simulate martian conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            GRASS has participated in this competition since 2021, and I joined the team in 2022 as a software developer. The team consists of two divisions: Engineering Division, with the goal of build and maintaining the rover, and Mission Support Division, publishing in social media, communicating with businesses and managining logistics and operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Mission Manager (CEO), I oversee all technical and non-technical parts of the team, with weekly meetings with department heads to coordinate our work. I set the direction of the team and organize it structurally, doing interviews with newcomers, writting team documentation and resources, etc. Moreover, I serve as the main representative for the team, communicating with stakeholders, competition organizers and university faculty.
