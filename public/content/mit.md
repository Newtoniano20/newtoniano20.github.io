# Edventures, Hackathons and the Engineering Design Workshop

The Edgerton Center is an organization which focuses on spreading the Hands-on philosophy of MIT, by running student clubs for MIT Students, K12 programs and an international outreach program that collaborates with schools and universities around the world.

My work inside the Edgerton Center is part of the **international outreach**, where I help organize hackathons and workshops, plus running zoom calls with groups around the world desigining their own projects.

Annually, we organize the MIT&CIC&UPC Hackathon, where +100 students around the barcelona metropolitan area, join and build a project, with no instructions, no topic, no constraints (a part of materials).

This role has given me the opportunity to travel to Italy and the United States to help run workshops in Ferrara, Italy with the [HoPE Program](https://hoperoitimit.com/) and [Engineering Design Workshop at MIT](https://edgerton.mit.edu/k-12-education/summer-programs/engineering-design-workshop). I have also helped groups in Chihuahua, Mexico during the HackKnights and [Workshop Challenge](https://www.icatech.edu.mx/workshop-challenge-mit-icatech-una-iniciativa-sin-precedentes-para-impulsar-el-talento-steam-en-chihuahua/), organized by Antonio Chavez and the Tecnológico de Monterrey.

During Summer 2024, I also attended the American Association of Physics Teachers Summer Summit, where Júlia Steinberg and I made a presentation ([Event Link](https://aapt-wm.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/67/sessiongallery/2944) | [Presentation](/aapt_presentation.pdf)) and poster ([Event Link](https://aapt-wm.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/67/sessiongallery/3009) | [Poster](/aapt_poster.pdf)) of our work with the Edgerton Center.

## TechProjects - A Hands-On High School Subject (2024-2025)
During the school year 2024 and 2025, I helped run TechProjects, a subject thaught in [CIC Batxillerats](https://cicbatxillerats.org/), a high school in Barcelona and my old school.

TechProjects is a class with two parts. The first, students are instructed to build a small toy, which they will work on for the first two months. For the rest of the year, after several sessions of ideation, students choose a project and work on it in collaboration with mentors like me and from MIT, who join in weekly meetings.

## Edventures - An International trip to run hackathons and workshops
During January, the Edgerton Center travels around the world, including Bulgaria, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Spain to organize and help run hackathons and workshops. I have been part of these trips since 2023, helping with hackathons in Italy and Spain.

The structure of the hackathons we organize, start with Ice Breakers and Ideation (+ Group Formation). 
Wednesdays morning are when students meet each other and form groups by ideas, not by friendship. After Lunch, they must try and build a cardboard prototype.
<img src="/assets/day1.png">
On day 2, students try and finish their cardboard prototype. Without their cardboard prototype (or equivalent) they are not given more expensive materials.
<img src="/assets/day2.png">
Day 3 is the final day. Their projects must be finished by lunch time and after that, we have a project forum and students showcase their project. Parents and family members also come during this time and a presenation and round table takes place that afternoon.

## Projects I have mentored
I have mentored many groups, some I have only seen once, others I saw weekly for a year. Here is a showcase of some of these. In total I have seen +150 groups.
<img src="/assets/showcase.png">

Some highlights include the following:
### Furrari - A Car for a Cat
<table style="border: none;">
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td width="40%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;">
      <img src="/assets/furrari2.jpg" width="100%">
    </td>
    <td width="60%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;font-size: 1.11vw">
      <p>
        The Furrari group built a car that was controlled by a Cat! I was one of the main mentors for this team, together with Christy, and so I spent most of my time with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The car is controlled by an ESP32 which talks via wifi with another ESP32, which was either the controller or a harness that the cat was wearing which had an IMU and reported the angle the cat was facing to the first ESP (the one on the Car itself). With both the angle the cat was facing and the car's angle, the car would steer towards whatever the cat "wanted".
      </p>
      <p>
        The body of the car was made using foam and sculpting it with a hot wire until it resembled a <b>Ferrari</b>, so it was hand-made!

### Sensorial Cabin - Inside Out
<table style="border: none;">
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td width="60%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;font-size: 1.11vw">
        <p>
            This project consisted on the building of a large cabin that could create certain emotions upon entering inside. The students’ description of it is: “The product will consist of stimuli for the senses of touch, hearing, sight, and smell, which will change according to the character from the movie.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            This idea comes from the film Inside Out, where each character is based on a different emotion and from that this project wants people to be able to feel these emotions.

        <p>
            This project was about building a vehicle that could be operated remotely and could move both on water and on ground. It was built by a group of high school students during the MIT&CIC&UPC Hackathon 2024.

### Light Saber
<table style="border: none;">
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td width="60%" style="vertical-align: top; border: none;font-size: 1.11vw">
        <p>
            During the 2023 Hackathon, I heard about a group of high schoolers who wanted to build a light saber, so I went to check out what they where up to and I immediately wanted to help these students as they shared great passion for this idea. This team was formed by people from different ages and schools, so they didn’t know each other at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started talking to them about what their ideas were and soon I realized they had no experience with Arduinos, nor soldering, nor sawing. Anything. So I took it upon myself to teach them these skills and mentor them on how they would like to build it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After two intense days of soldering, coding and 3D Printing they where able to build a working prototype of a light saber. It had an animation when it was turned on and off and used an opaque cylinder to cover the LEDs inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the hackathon, this was one of its major projects and it has been mentioned in several interviews to the organizers (<a href="https://educa.barcelona/2023/02/09/alicia-lopez-la-hackato-dona-llibertat-a-lalumne-per-fer-el-projecte-que-vulgui/">Alicia Lopez at educa.barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/22/1076988/edgerton-center-instructor-takes-mens-et-manus-mindset-on-the-road/">Edward Moriarty at MIT Technology Review</a> )
